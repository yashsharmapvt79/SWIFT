# SWIFT - My Swift Programming Practice

Welcome to the **SWIFT** repository! This repository contains the Swift programs and projects I've built so far as part of my journey in learning the Swift programming language. 🚀

## 📖 About the Repository

This repository is designed to:
- Track my progress as I learn and build with Swift.
- Serve as a reference for beginner-level Swift programs.
- Showcase simple solutions to common programming challenges implemented in Swift.

## 💡 What's Included?

### Programs So Far:
1. **Add Two Numbers**  
   - A simple program to sum two numbers.
   - Demonstrates the usage of constants (`let`) and variables (`var`).

2. **User Input and Summation**  
   - Takes two numbers as input from the user, performs a sum, and handles invalid inputs.

3. **Coming Soon**  
   - More advanced features such as functions, loops, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Swift.

## 🛠️ How to Use
